# Purrfect 🐱 🐾

This website has only one purpose - to show cat illustrations in vibrant colors! I've implemented a color picker that allows users to select their preferred color, which changes the color of all SVGs and the background. To enhance the user experience, if the user choses a color with a lightness greater than 50, the background automatically shifts to a darker shade for improved contrast. Feel free to use this repository to add your own vector illustrations and create something cool!
